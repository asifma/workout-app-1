# Workout App

Workout tracking app with VUE and Firebase.

## Ideas

To be converted to requirements or stories:

- [ ] I want to have a login page
- [ ] I want to see a list of excercicies
- [ ] I want to see a detail view of each exercice
- [ ] I want to have workout recommendations for the day
- [ ] I want to have workout recommendations based on the desired duration time.
- [ ] I want to be able to "check-in" into an excercice
- [ ] I want to have a Profile page (name and photo)
- [ ] I want to my Profile page to show latest excercicies
- [ ] I want to my Profile page to show most done exercicies
- [ ] I want to my Profile page to show how many days or hours I've trained this month
- [ ] I want to my Profile page to show all time workout times (days or hours, or both?)
- [ ] I want to have a Leaderboard page, ranking users for most hours trained.
